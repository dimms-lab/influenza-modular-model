# Modeling Seasonal Influenza Dynamics Using Modular Arithmetic

This repository contains the source code and data for the paper: *"Modeling Seasonal Influenza Dynamics Using Modular Arithmetic for Time-Varying Transmission Rates"*.

## Overview

This project develops and validates a seasonal Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model for influenza. The core innovation is the use of a modular arithmetic framework to define a time-varying transmission rate, $\beta(t)$. The work is presented in two stages:
1.  A theoretical exploration of the model's dynamics.
2.  A calibration and validation of the model against real-world influenza surveillance data from Ontario, Canada (2014-2019).

## Repository Contents

*   `Seasonal_SIRS_Quarter_vs_Calendar_formal_split.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the theoretical model development, scenario analysis (immunity duration, interventions), and generation of Figures 1-5.
*   `Seasonal_SIRS_Modular_Beta_Ontario_2014_2019_formal_split.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for calibrating the model against the Ontario influenza data and generating Figure 6.
*   `Influenza cases for all ages, for all sexes, in Ontario.csv`: The public surveillance data used for model calibration.
*   The various `.png` files are the figures generated by the notebooks, as presented in the paper, and are located in the main repository directory.

## How to Run the Code

The notebooks were developed using Python. The primary dependencies required to run the code are:
*   `numpy`
*   `pandas`
*   `scipy`
*   `matplotlib`

To reproduce the results, open and run the cells in the respective Jupyter Notebooks. Ensure the `.csv` data file is in the same directory as the notebooks.
